A 6 DoF robot arm using python to control the servos and html/javascript/css for web based controller.

For smart servos, I am using Dynamixel AX-12A from [Robotis](https://www.robotis.us/dynamixel-ax-12a-6pcs-bulk/). Full parts list below.

### Hardware

- 7x Dynamixel AX-12A servos from [Robotis](https://www.robotis.us/dynamixel-ax-12a-6pcs-bulk/)
- 1x Raspberry Pi. Any model will do as long as it can run python and has USB port. I have [Pi 3 Model B](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/)
- 11x engineered plastic [planar frames](https://www.robotis.us/fp04-f3-10pcs/). You could do with less depending on how exactly you want to assemble. Mine used 11
- 3x engineered plastic [C frames](https://www.robotis.us/fp04-f2-10pcs/)
- 1x [U2D2](https://www.robotis.us/u2d2/)
- 1x [U2D2 Power Hub](https://www.robotis.us/u2d2-power-hub-board-set/). Because the Pi's USB cannot give enough power to the servos
- 1x set of bushings, spaces, nuts & bolts from [Robotis](https://www.robotis.us/bolt-nut-set-bns-10/)
- 1x Trossen Robotics - PhantomX Parallel [AX-12 Gripper](https://robosavvy.co.uk/trossen-robotics-phantomx-parallel-ax-12-gripper-no-servo.html)
- 1x LiPo battery with 3 cells. These servos operate at 9-12 volts. Any mAh will do, but larger ones will last longer. I have [Zeee 5200mAh](https://www.amazon.com/Zeee-Connector-Batteries-Fireproof-Explosionproof/dp/B0CTFDBBJV)
